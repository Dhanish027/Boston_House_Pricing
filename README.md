### Boston House Pricing Prediction

In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Boston’s suburbs.

Once we get a good fit, we will use this model to predict the monetary value of a house located at the Boston’s area.

A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make use of the information provided in a dayly basis.

3. [VSCodeIDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Prediction and Final Score:

Finally we made it!!!

# Linear Regression

Model Score: 73.1% Accuracy
Training Accuracy: 72.9% Accuracy
Testing Accuracy: 73.1% Accuracy

# Random Forest Regressor

Training Accuracy: 99.9% Accuracy.
Testing Accuracy: 99.8% Accuracy

## Conclusion:

From the Exploratory Data Analysis, we could generate insight from the data. How each of the features relates to the target. Also, it can be seen from the evaluation of three models that Random Forest Regressor performed better than Linear Regression.
